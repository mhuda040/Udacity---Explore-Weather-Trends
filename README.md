# Udacity---Explore-Weather-Trends
Explore Weather Trends Project

In this project, we will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends
to overall global temperature trends. For this project, we will use London, United Kingdom as the city to
examine such trends.

In addition, and for purposes of this project, all temperatures are recorded in Celsius (ÂºC).

Details of the project are included in the files uploaded to this directory.  All Python code is included in the PDF.
